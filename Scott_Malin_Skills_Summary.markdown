## Core Expertise Areas – Role-Tagged  
### Host Firewall Policy  
- **Primary SME (2002-2024)** – owned enterprise Defender Firewall strategy; backed by Garfield → Rich → Arturo over the years.  
  → Designed **3-tier location-aware ruleset** (Public = max lock-down, Domain = balanced, Private = N/A for enterprise).  
  → ~30 elegant rules delivered full protection across 250,000 endpoints; zero-outage Symantec → Defender cut-over.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer → Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health  

### Endpoint Privilege Management  
- **Led BeyondTrust EPM implementation (2022-2024, pre-layoff)** – ~2,500 devs, ServiceNow workflow, PowerShell discovery; reduced local admin privileges by stripping ~5K elevated accounts on Windows 10 endpoints.  
  **Role:** Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health  

### Off-Host AV Architecture  
- **McAfee MOVE (2012-2014)** – 200 **Windows virtual scanner nodes**, 40k VDI, killed disk storms.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer – Aetna  
- **Reversed to SEP (2014)** – decommissioned when low-impact engines matured.

## Security Clearance  
- **None held** – eligible for Secret upon sponsorship.  

## Interview Prep Quick Notes
- General approach: Keep answers short, positive, tie to experience. Use STAR format when possible.
- Focus on: 30 years tenure, Defender Firewall SME, BeyondTrust PAM rollout, Symantec → CrowdStrike migration, Zero Trust contributions, automation wins (40% vuln drop, 80% manual reduction), incident leadership (100% SLA).
