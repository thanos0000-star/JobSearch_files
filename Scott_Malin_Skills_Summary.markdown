## Core Expertise Areas – Role-Tagged  
### Host Firewall Policy  
- **Primary SME (2002-2024)** – owned enterprise Defender Firewall strategy; backed by Garfield → Rich → Arturo over the years.  
  → Designed **3-tier location-aware ruleset** (Public = max lock-down, Domain = balanced, Private = N/A for enterprise).  
  → ~30 elegant rules delivered full protection across 250,000 endpoints; zero-outage Symantec → Defender cut-over.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer → Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health  

### Endpoint Privilege Management  
- **Led BeyondTrust EPM implementation (2022-2024, pre-layoff)** – ~2,500 devs, ServiceNow workflow, PowerShell discovery; reduced local admin privileges by stripping ~5K elevated accounts on Windows 10 endpoints.  
  **Role:** Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health  

### Off-Host AV Architecture  
- **McAfee MOVE (2012-2014)** – 200 **Windows virtual scanner nodes**, 40k VDI, killed disk storms.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer – Aetna  
- **Reversed to SEP (2014)** – decommissioned grid, leveraged new low-impact engine.

### CrowdStrike Consolidation  
- **Symantec → CrowdStrike (2022-2023)** – led Symantec Endpoint Protection removal across ~120K endpoints (90% Windows workstations/servers, plus macOS/Linux); activated AV/NGAV on existing sensors (~2016), streamlining environment and decommissioning 10 virtual servers.  
  **Role:** Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health (backup SME on original Falcon rollout)  

- **Long-game win**: sensors I helped deploy in ~2016 became the “no-touch” foundation for the 2023 AV flip, enabling streamlined consolidation.  
  **Role:** Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health (backup SME on original Falcon rollout)  

### Zero Trust & Identity  
- **Contributed to Zero Trust via Intune + Entra ID + Zscaler Conditional Access** – supported policies for 35-40 % lateral-movement reduction.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer → Senior Security Engineer – CVS Health  

### MFA & Validation  
- **Dual-MFA (Symantec VIP + Microsoft Authenticator)** – PowerShell recovery → 60 % fewer help-desk calls.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer → Senior Security Engineer – Aetna/CVS Health  

- **Linux validation server recovery menu** – shell scripts navigated deep log dirs, deleted orphaned .pid/.ppid files, restarted crashed services in <2 min (vs 15+).  
  **Role:** Security Engineer – Aetna  

- **Symantec VIP policy overhaul** – redesigned LDAP queries to Secure LDAP, audited admin accounts, stripped unneeded help-desk privileg...(truncated 1855 characters)...ed **hundreds of pages** of runbooks, playbooks, and troubleshooting guides.  
  **Role:** Security Engineer → Senior Security Engineer – Aetna/CVS Health

## Early Career Highlights  
- **Desktop Support (1994-1998)** – designed **universal boot floppy** for DOS/Windows 3.1 fleet.  
  → Packed **all Token-Ring NIC drivers + IPX/SPX** on one disk.  
  → Later: **single-disk TCP/IP boot** via RAM-disk + ZIP extraction; used **timestamp as unique hostname** (1/100 sec) → zero Ghost multicast collisions.  
  → Evolved to bootable CDs; **directly earned promotion to Regional Admin**.  
  **Role:** Desktop Support Engineer – Aetna  

- **Regional Admin (1998-2002)** – senior escalation tier; scripted desktop workflows, resolved complex hardware/OS issues.
